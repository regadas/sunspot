= Sunspot

http://outoftime.github.com/sunspot

Sunspot is a Ruby library for expressive, powerful interaction with the Solr
search engine. Sunspot is built on top of the RSolr library, which
provides a low-level interface for Solr interaction; Sunspot provides a simple,
intuitive, expressive DSL backed by powerful features for indexing objects and
searching for them.

Sunspot is designed to be easily plugged in to any ORM, or even non-database-backed
objects such as the filesystem.

=== Where to learn all about Sunspot: The Wiki!

New to Sunspot and using Rails? Check out {Adding Sunspot search to Rails in 5
minutes or less}[http://wiki.github.com/outoftime/sunspot/adding-sunspot-search-to-rails-in-5-minutes-or-less].

This README is intended as a quick primer on what Sunspot is capable of; for
detailed treatment of Sunspot's full feature range, check out the wiki:
http://wiki.github.com/outoftime/sunspot

The API documentation is also complete and up-to-date; however, because of the
way Sunspot is structured, it's not the easiest way for new users to get to know
the library.

=== Features:

* Define indexing strategy for each searchable class using intuitive block-based
  API
* Clean separation between keyword-searchable fields and fields for
  scoping/ordering
* Define fields based on existing attributes or "virtual fields" for custom
  indexing
* Indexes each object's entire superclass hierarchy, for easy searching for all
  objects inheriting from a parent class
* Intuitive DSL for scoping searches, with all the usual boolean operators
  available
* Intuitive interface for requesting facets on indexed fields
* Extensible adapter architecture for easy integration of other ORMs or
  non-model classes
* Refine search using field facets, date range facets, or ultra-powerful
  query facets
* Full compatibility with will_paginate
* Ordering by field value, relevance, geographical distance, or random

== Installation

  gem install sunspot

In order to start the packaged Solr installation, run:

  sunspot-solr start -- [-d /path/to/data/directory] [-p port] [-s path/to/solr/home] [--pid-dir=path/to/pid/dir]

If you don't specify a data directory, your Solr index will be stored in your
operating system's temporary directory.

If you specify a solr home, the directory must contain a <code>conf</code>
directory, which should contain at least <code>schema.xml</code> and
<code>solrconfig.xml</code>. Be sure to copy the <code>schema.xml</code> out of
the Sunspot gem's <code>solr/solr/conf</code> directory. Sunspot relies on the
field name patterns defined in the packaged <code>schema.xml</code>, so those
cannot be modified.

You can also run your own instance of Solr wherever you'd like; just copy the solr/config/schema.xml file out of the gem's solr into your installation.
You can change the URL at which Sunspot accesses Solr by setting <code>SOLR_URL</code> in your application's environment, or assigning it to Sunspot's configuration directly:

  Sunspot.config.solr.url = 'http://solr.my.host:9818/solr'

== Rails Integration

The Sunspot::Rails plugin makes integrating Sunspot into Rails drop-in easy.

    gem install sunspot_rails

See the README for that gem or the Sunspot Wiki for more information.

== Using Sunspot

=== Define an index:

  class Post
    #...
  end

  Sunspot.setup(Post) do
    text :title, :description, :stored => true
    string :author_name
    integer :blog_id
    integer :category_ids
    float :average_rating, :using => :ratings_average
    time :published_at
    string :sort_title do
      title.downcase.sub(/^(an?|the)\W+/, ''/) if title = self.title
    end
  end

See Sunspot.setup for more information.

Note that in order for a class to be searchable, it must have an adapter
registered for itself or one of its subclasses. Adapters allow Sunspot to load
objects out of persistent storage, and to determine their primary key for
indexing. {Sunspot::Rails}[http://github.com/outoftime/sunspot_rails] comes with
an adapter for ActiveRecord objects, but for other types of models you will need
to define your own. See Sunspot::Adapters for more information.

=== Search for objects:
  
  @search = Sunspot.search Post do
    keywords 'great pizza' do 
      highlight :title, :description
    end
    with :author_name, 'Mark Twain'
    with(:blog_id).any_of [2, 14]
    with(:category_ids).all_of [4, 10]
    with(:published_at).less_than Time.now
    any_of do
      with(:expired_at).greater_than(Time.now)
      with(:expired_at, nil)
    end
    without :title, 'Bad Title'
    without bad_instance # specifically exclude this instance from results

    paginate :page => 3, :per_page => 15
    order_by :average_rating, :desc

    facet :blog_id
  end

See Sunspot.search for more information.

=== Work with search results (Haml for readability):

  .facets
    ul.blog_facet
      - @search.facet(:blog_id).rows.each do |row|
        li.facet_row
          = link_to(row.instance.name, params.merge(:blog_id => row.value))
          %span.count== (#{row.count})
  .page_info== Displaying page #{@search.hits.page} of #{@search.hits.per_page} out of #{@search.total} results
  - @search.each_hit_with_result do |hit, post|
    .search_result
      %h3.title
        = link_to(h(hit.stored(:title)), post_url(post))
      - if hit.score
        %span.relevance== (#{hit.score})
      %p= hit.highlight(:description).format { |word| "<span class=\"highlight\">#{word}</span>" }
  .pagination= will_paginate(@search.hits)

== About the API documentation

All of the methods documented in the RDoc are considered part of Sunspot's
public API. Methods that are not part of the public API are documented in the
code, but excluded from the RDoc. If you find yourself needing to access methods
that are not part of the public API in order to do what you need, please contact
me so I can rectify the situation!

== Dependencies

1. RSolr
2. Java 1.5+

Sunspot has been tested with MRI 1.8.6 and 1.8.7, REE 1.8.6, YARV 1.9.1, and
JRuby 1.6.0. 

Note: JRuby must have 1.9 option enabled.

    export JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9 sunspot-solr start

== Bugs

Please submit bug reports to
http://outoftime.lighthouseapp.com/projects/20339-sunspot

== Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are very welcome - both new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.
Bug reports with a failing regression test are also lovely. In order to keep the
contribution process as organized and smooth as possible, please follow these
guidelines:

* Contributions should be submitted via Sunspot's Lighthouse account, with an
  attached git patch. See below for how to create a git patch.
* Patches should not make any changes to the gemspec task other than
  adding/removing dependencies (e.g., changing the name, version, email,
  description, etc.)
* Patches should not include any changes to the gemspec itself.
* Document any new methods, options, arguments, etc.
* Write tests.
* As much as possible, follow the coding and testing styles you see in existing
  code. One could accuse me of being nitpicky about this, but consistent code is
  easier to read, maintain, and enhance.
* Don't make any massive changes to the structure of library or test code. If
  you think something needs a huge refactor or rearrangement, shoot me a
  message; trying to apply that kind of patch without warning opens the door to
  a world of conflict hurt.

Here's how to create a Git patch - assuming you're pulling from the canonical
Sunspot repository at `upstream`:

  git fetch upstream
  git format-patch --stdout upstream/master.. > my-awesome.patch
